# Casa
Casa is a procedural house generator built in Houdini and based on the colorful houses within the "Ciudad Amurallada" (Walled City) of Cartagena, Colombia. 

The generator procedurally places a spanish-style balcony, archways, and windows along the building's facade and allows the user control over the dimensions of each floor
